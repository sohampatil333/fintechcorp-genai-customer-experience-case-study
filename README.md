# FinTechCorp: GenAI-Driven Customer Experience Case Study  
A complete Generative AI–powered business analysis of FinTechCorp’s customer experience crisis, based on a dataset of 10,000 customer feedback records.  
Includes full data interpretation, NPS insights, BRD creation, and a proposed solution architecture for a **Customer Feedback Intelligence (CFI) Platform**.

## 📌 Project Overview
This case study applies **Generative AI** and prompt-driven analysis to identify, diagnose, and solve FinTechCorp’s customer dissatisfaction issues.

The core challenge identified:
- **62.66% of customers are Detractors (NPS 0–6)**  
- **Average NPS is only 5.07**  
- **Feedback text is corrupted with placeholder nonsense** (making traditional qualitative analysis impossible)  
- **Resolution time averages 37.04 hours**, with *no correlation* to sentiment

AI was used to analyze patterns, generate insights, and design a strategic transformation solution.
